    <h2>How the Web Works</h2>
    <p>The web is full of computers
      (Server) and they communicate with
      each other. The <b>HTTP
      (Hyper Text Transfer Protokol)</b> is
      used for communication. When I
      open a webpage in the browser then
      the bworser sends an <b>HTTP Request</b>
      and the server sends to the client
      (me) a HTTP Respones. The webbrowser
      interpret the respones and display
      the result (webpage).</p>

      of an HTML document</b>. It gives HTML tags for bold,
      italic, paragraphs, links
